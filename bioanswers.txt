What is the problem?
	Detecting the common protein domains for the given organisms and search terms.

What tools, databases you are going to use?

Database : Uniprot
Web Service : Uniprot Rest Api
Tools : Perl, Unix Commands

Steps

1- we got taxonomy id using scientific name from UniProt. We wrote script with perl for this step. (we already made it)
2- we will get proteins using this taxononomy id and given search term. We will do this step using Uniprot Rest Api. We will write query to UniProt Rest Api and it will send us proteins and details.
3- We will get INTERPRO(protein domain) domain identifiers for these proteins.
4- we will show common INTERPRO domain identifiers for all given these proteins.
5- we will show how frequent these INTERPROs for all given organisms.
Finally we will report that  show tthe users INTERPRO statistics  & Common Proteins.
